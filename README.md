# CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT

**To Start testing you can download the library here.** 
```
implementation("io.github.thearchitect123:NeuralKMP:0.0.4")
```

**Please note this is still in development and subject to change.** Please also note that by downloading this artifact, you are downloading all the TensorFlow models at once.

Reflection will be used to dynamically load the models (currently all the models have to be loaded), but configuration is available via your local gradle.properties file.
You can use these keys to choose which modules to download/enable.
